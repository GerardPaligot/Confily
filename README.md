## Architecture

Kotlin Multiplatform project where `:androidApp` and `:iosApp` share the same
codebase for the business logic (with `:shared` module). `:backend` and `:shared` modules 
share the same models due to `:models` module and avoid any errors in the parsing of backend
responses.

3 design system are used in this project and can be found in `theme-{ds-name}`. All these
modules contains `features` and `ui` modules to bind Composable with their ViewModels and to 
create all components of the Design System.

## Testing

### Running in local

Start firebase emulators inside a terminal with Firestore service.

```bash
firebase login # If you are not yet logged
firebase emulators:start --project $RANDOM_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
```

Start appengine server inside another terminal to interact with the
local instance of your Firebase.

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/key.json
export PROJECT_ID=$RANDOM_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
export BASE_URL_CONFERENCE_HALL=conference-hall.io
./gradlew :backend:installDist && ./backend/build/install/backend/bin/backend
```

Now, you can start to interact with the backend.

### Deploy in GCP

#### Prerequisites

* Billing account enabled on your GCP project
* Gcloud app created: `gcloud app create`
* Cloud Build service enabled
* Cloud Firestore service enabled
* Secret Manager enabled
* Geocoding enabled
* Add secret `GEOCODE_API_KEY` in Secret Manager with geocoding api key

#### Deploy in GCP with AppEngine

Be sure to edit the `app.yaml` file in `backend/src/main/appengine` folder with your project id 
before to deploy.

```bash
# If you are not yet logged
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
# Deploy in production
./gradlew :backend:appengineDeploy
```

#### Deploy in GCP with Cloud Run

```bash
# If you are not yet logged
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
# Deploy in production
gcloud builds submit --timeout 1h --tag gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$IMAGE:$TAG .
gcloud run deploy $IMAGE --image=eu.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$IMAGE:$TAG \
  --platform managed \
  --port 8080 \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --set-env-vars=IS_CLOUD=true \
  --set-env-vars=BASE_URL_CONFERENCE_HALL=conference-hall.io \
  --set-env-vars=PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_ID \
  --set-env-vars=GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```
