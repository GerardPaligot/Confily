## Testing

### Running in local

Start firebase emulators inside a terminal with Firestore service.

```bash
firebase login # If you are not yet logged
firebase emulators:start --project $RANDOM_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
```

Start appengine server inside another terminal to interact with the
local instance of your Firebase.

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/key.json
export PROJECT_ID=$RANDOM_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
export BASE_URL_CONFERENCE_HALL=conference-hall.io
./gradlew :backend:installDist && ./backend/build/install/backend/bin/backend
```

Now, you can start to interact with the backend.
